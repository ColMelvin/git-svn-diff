git-svn-diff

Show changes between the working copy and an SVN revision, or changes
between 2 SVN revisions.  The diff format is (mostly) compatible with
SVN; that is, the diff is in the SVN style.

This is mostly targeted at programs that connect to an SVN repository
and therefore need the extra SVN specific data (e.g. code review
applications).  For transferring patches to an SVN working copy,
consider using git-diff(1) along with patch(1).
