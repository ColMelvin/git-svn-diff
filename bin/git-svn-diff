=end text

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Show changes between the working copy and an SVN revision, or changes
between 2 SVN revisions.  The diff format is (mostly) compatible with
SVN; that is, the diff is in the SVN style.

This is mostly targeted at programs that connect to an SVN repository
and therefore need the extra SVN specific data (e.g. code review
applications).  For transferring patches to an SVN working copy,
consider using B<git-diff>(1) along with B<patch>(1).

Since this program targets applications connecting to an SVN repository,
all diffs must be made against a revision in that repository.  Thus, the
<since> parameter must always correspond to an SVN revision fetched into
the git repository.  The <until> parameter may be any commit, or may be
omitted to specify the working copy.  The index cannot be used for
comparison.

If no <commit> objects are specified (including through -r & -c), then
the diff acts as though C<-r BASE> was specified.  That is, it compares
the working copy to the last revision in SVN (on this branch), just like
C<svn diff>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item <since>

A git commit object or an SVN revision identifier.  If the identifier is
not recognized by git, then it is processed as an SVN identifier.  An
'r' may come before the revision, to help disambiguate from a git
object.  In addition, the following SVN revision keywords are supported:
BASE, COMMITTED, & PREV.  See C<--revision> for futher details.

This commit must be a revision in the SVN repository.  If left
unspecified, the SVN identifier 'BASE' is used.  Note that C<-r> &
C<-c> both set the <since> value.  See C<--revision> for more details
on specifying SVN revisions.

=item <until>

Like <since>, this is a git commit object or an SVN revision; however,
it does not need to be a commit of an SVN revision. If left
unspecified, the diff is compared against the working copy.  Note that
C<-r> (with a second value) & C<-c> both set the <until> value.

=item -r, --revision=<N>[:<M>]

Specifies the SVN revisions to use for <since> [and <until>].  This is
useful for avoiding using git objects, e.g. if a branch named "BASE"
exists.  Revisions must be a positive integer, but may be prefixed with
an 'r'.

Some SVN branch keywords are supported: BASE, COMMITTED, & PREV.  The
BASE keyword identifies the latest SVN revision of this branch; that is,
the revision (commit) against which work was done.  The COMMITTED
keyword refers to the latest SVN revision of the branch that modified
the included <paths>.  Using BASE ignores when the <paths> were changed.
Finally, PREV corresponds to the commit just prior to COMMITTED, that is
"COMMITTED^".  Keywords are all uppercase.  The HEAD keyword (in the SVN
sense) is unavailable.

Note that all revisions are with respect to the current branch.  If a
specified revision edited another branch, the latest revision on this
branch (before the specified revision) is used.

=item -c, --change=<rev>

Identical to C<-r N-1:N> if <rev> is positive; C<-r N:N-1> if <rev> is
negative, where S<< N = abs(<rev>) >>.

=item --relative-repo

Changes paths to be relative to the SVN Repository Root.  A file
F<README.txt> on branch "experimental" is actually located at
F<branches/experimental/README.txt>.  This option adds the branch/tag
path to the filename to correctly identify which branch was changed.

Not recommended for use in conjunction with C<--relative>, as
"branches/experimental/" would be prepended to a relative path.

Note that the git annotations (--git) are not affected by this option.

=item --global-revision

Use a single revision number all files in the diff header, regardless
of which revision they were actually edited in (default).  This method
takes less work and is therefore the default.

  config key: svn.diffGlobalRevision

=item --no-global-revision

Use a file-specific revision number for each file in the diff header.
Revisions denote when the file was last edited prior to or including the
revision being compared.

E.g. if a file were edited in revisions 3, 4, 7 & 11 and the user runs
C<< git-svn-diff --revision=5:10 >> the diff header would look as
follows:

	Index: file.txt
	===================================================================
	--- file.txt	(revision 4)
	+++ file.txt	(revision 7)

rather than as:

	Index: file.txt
	===================================================================
	--- file.txt	(revision 5)
	+++ file.txt	(revision 10)

=item --show-in-function

Displays the C function name in which the chunk resides (default).

=item --no-show-in-function

Disables --show-in-function.  This is the default in SVN, but not in
git.  Useful if an older program gets confused by the extra data.

=item --git

Adds (well, retains) git annotations like C<new file 100644> in the
output diff.

  config key: svn.diffWithAnnotations

=item --no-git

Disables git annotations in output diff (default).

=item <git-diff>

Other options will be passed on to B<git-diff>(1).

While most git-diff options are allowed (though they may cause a fatal
error), a few are explicitly blocked as they would interfere with
git-svn-diff directly.  They are as follows: -R, --no-prefix,
--src-prefix, & --dst-prefix.

=item <path>

The <paths> parameters, when given, are used to limit the diff to the
named paths (you can give directory names and get diff for all files
under them).

Files included under the <path> options are used when resolving the SVN
identifiers COMMITTED & PREV (see L<--revision> for details).

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

Comparing the working copy to the SVN tree

  $ git-svn-diff                    <1>
  $ git-svn-diff --git              <2>
  $ git-svn-diff --relative-repo    <3>

All three of the above examples compare the working copy to the BASE
revision (i.e. the revision in SVN that was branched from).  This is the
most common use case.  In particular, <3> is useful when submitting to
items aware of the various branches.

Matching C<svn diff> more closely

The following commands are nearly equivalent (assuming default
configuration options).  They both compare the working copy to the
latest commit on the SVN server in this branch.

  $ svn diff
  $ git-svn-diff --relative=. --no-show-in-function

Note the extra options; these cause the behavior to be closer to what
C<svn diff> does, but are generally not necessary.  The output without
these options is close enough as makes no real difference.

Comparing commits in git but not in SVN

  $ git-svn-diff -r BASE HEAD       <1>
  $ git-svn-diff BASE HEAD          <2>

In these examples, a comparison is once again made against the BASE
revision, but with the latest commit in this branch (notably excluding
working copy & index changes).  The <1> version is preferred over <2>
because it would not be adversly affected by a branch named "BASE".

Comparing against earlier revisions in SVN

  $ git-svn-diff -r 345             <1>
  $ git-svn-diff HEAD~5             <2>

The above compare the working copy against a revision that either is
or comes before the BASE revision.  If in <2> the given commit is not in
the SVN repository then a fatal error will occur.

=head1 CAVEATS

Unlike B<git-diff>(1), this program I<requires> that the C<--> option be
provided before listing files.

Only critical options of B<git-diff>(1) are disallowed (see <git-diff>).
However, certain options will output data that git-svn-diff cannot
process and will thus trigger a fatal parsing error.  Some of those
options include:

=over 4

=item --name-only

=item --name-status

=item --raw (and family)

=item --stat (and family)

=item --summary

=back

Additionally, many other options may behave differently under
git-svn-diff than under B<git-diff>(1).  Below is a non-exhaustive
list of options that will behave differently:

=over 4

=item --cached

When a commit is not specified, BASE is used instead of HEAD for the
comparison.  Thus, diffs may contain more than just the changes to the
index.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Renames are not properly handled; the new filename is not reflected in
the diff, but the changes are.  There is no plan to fix this currently;
it may be if demand exists.

Options "--relative" and "--relative-repo" do not play together nicely.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

SVN properties diffs are not supported, including svn:executable.  Try
using git annotations (--git) for the executable bit.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The following B<git-config>(1) options are supported:

=over 4

=item svn.diffGlobalRevision

A boolean value where C<true> specifies that C<--global-revision>
should be the default and C<false> defaults to C<--no-global-revision>.

=item svn.diffWithAnnotations

A boolean value where C<true> specifies that C<--git> should be the
default and C<false> defaults to C<--no-git>.
